# Fuckboy as a Service

Literally because I saw a bad joke on Twitter, and because I wanted to learn how to make a RESTful API, I'm going to do this. This API is super NSFW.

## Why does this exist?
* It was a funny idea to me at the time
* When dumb guys say dumb things its almost always the same bs, so use these to emulate them to all your friends!

## How do I run this amazing invention?
=======
### You will need:
* node.js + npm
* Postman or some sort of API reader

1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` to install all the packages required
3. Inside root, run `npm start` and you're good to go!
4. From postman to access API calls just use /api and look inside the routes/api.js file to see what you can do!

## Can I extend it?
Sure! I'm not gonna stop you, and neither will that guy who's telling you he'll never be like the other guys either
